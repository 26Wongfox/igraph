Here is how to run this simple proof-of-concept application:

1 Go to igraphx/ and run a Python web server:
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2 Start R and run (=copy and paste to the R prompt) part 1 from the 
  websock.R file

3 Set 'mygraph' to the graph you want to plot, and run part 2 from websock.R.

4 Start a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/templates/basic.html
  This should layout and plot the graph. The nodes can be dragged.

5 Add vertices and edges from the R prompt, see part 3 in websock.R.
  The vertices and edges show up on the plot in the browser windows as well.

6 You can start another browser window or tab and using the same URL
  (http://127.0.0.1:8000/templates/basic.html) you'll get the visuzalization 
  of the updated graph.

7 Run part 4 from websock.R to close down the connection between the 
  server and the browser.
