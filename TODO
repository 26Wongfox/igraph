Needed for 0.2:

o document bison requirements
o repair simplify
o Laplacian of a graph, in R only
o attribute handling for operators
o add references to SNA, paper by Carter
o for almost all functions: add progress handlers and allow
  them to be interrupted using IGRAPH_ALLOW_INTERRUPTION()
o uniform graph operators (union, intersection, etc...)
o merging layouts properly, multicompartmental layout functions
o make CTRL+C work in R
o better random number generator handling (init with seed, etc...)
o rewrite iterators
o R interface to all (sensible) functions
o proper documentation (docbook & R) for all (sensible) functions
o get non-structural info from Pajek files
o write Pajek file
o read and write non-structural info from/to GraphML files
o better looking graphs in 3D in the R interface
o rewite add_edges, add_vertices, delete_edges, delete_vertices,
  they're a mess
o edge seq argument to delete_edges

Other bits:

o eccentricity

o topological equaivalence of graphs (hard)
o make possible building in separate directory (make check, r package,
  make dist do not work)
o write tutorial
o add some iterators: in-, pre-, post-order, depth-first, breadth-first
  search, iterators based on attributes etc.
o add methods for reading & saving a file together with its attributes
o add conversion methods for different file formats
o community detection algorithms
o add data sets to the R package
o add automatic tests, add valgrind option to tests (?)
o make docs look better: index, section tocs
o make better and faster doxrox engine
o create man pages
o implement IGRAPH_STRONG in igraph_decompose
o top-down and radial layout algorithm for tree graphs
o Hamilton and Euler circles/paths
o method to turn the edges to the opposite direction in a graph
o Python inteface: some useful iterators:
  o iterator over all components
  o iterator over all circles
o selective copy: copy only selected edges with attributes
o method for vertex and edge to return all attrs as a hash
