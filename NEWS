igraph 0.4.5
=========

Released January 1, 2008

New:
- Cohesive block finding in the R interface, thanks to Peter McMahan
  for contributing his code. See James Moody and Douglas R. White,
  2003, in Structural Cohesion and Embeddedness: A Hierarchical
  Conception of Social Groups American Sociological Review 68(1):1-25 
- Biconnected components and articulation points.
- R interface: better printing of attributes.
- R interface: graph attributes can be used via '$'.

New in the C library: 
- igraph_vector_bool_t data type.

Bug fixed:
- Erdos-Renyi random graph generators rewritten.

=========
igraph 0.4.4
=========

Released October 3, 2007

This release should work seemlessly with the new R 2.6.0 version.
Some other bugs were also fixed:
- A bug was fixed in the Erdos-Renyi graph generator, which sometimes
  added an extra vertex.
- MSVC compilation issues were fixed.
- MinGW compilation fixes.

=========
igraph 0.4.3
=========

Released August 13, 2007

The next one in the sequence of bugfix releases. Thanks to many people
sending bug reports. Here are the changes:
- Some memory leaks removed when using attributes from R or Python.
- GraphML parser: entities and character data in multiple chunks are now handled correctly.
- A bug corrected in edge betweenness community structure detection,
  it failed if called many times from the same program/session.
- Bug corrected in 'adjacent edges' edge iterator.
- Python interface: edge and vertex attribute deletion bug corrected.
- Edge betweeness community structure: handle unconnected graphs properly.
- Fixed bug related to fast greedy community detection in unconnected graphs.
- Use a different kind of parser (Push) for reading GraphML files. This is almost
  invisible for users but fixed a nondeterministic bug when reading in GraphML
  files.
- R interface: plot now handles properly if called with a vector as the edge.width
  argument for directed graphs.
- R interface: bug (typo) corrected for walktrap.community and weighted graphs.
- Test suite should run correctly on Cygwin now.

=========
igraph 0.4.2
=========

Released June 7, 2007

This is another bugfix release, as there was a serious bug in the 
R package of the previous version: it could not read and write graphs
to files in any format under MS Windows.

Some other bits added: 
- circular Reingold-Tilford layout generator for trees
- corrected a bug, Pajek files are written properly under MS Windows now.
- arrow.size graphical edge parameter added in the R interface.

  faster now: transitivity, reciprocity, graph operator functions like 
  intersection and union, etc.

  platform in the near future, but these are undocumented now

and many more.

New things in the R package:

Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.

====================
igraph mailing lists
====================

Aug 18, 2006

I've set up two igraph mailing lists: igraph-help for
general igraph questions and discussion and
igraph-anonunce for announcements. See 
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help and
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce
for subscription information, archives, etc.

=========
igraph 0.1
=========

Released Jan 30, 2006

After about a year of development this is the first "official" release 
of the igraph library. This release should be considered as beta 
software, but it should be useful in general. Please send your 
questions and comments.
