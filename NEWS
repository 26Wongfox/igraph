The major new additions in this release is a bunch of community
detection algorithms and support for the GML file format. Here 
is the complete list of changes:


New in the C library
--------------------

- internal representation changed
- neighbors always returns an ordered list
- igraph_is_loop and igraph_is_multiple added

- igraph_community_to_membership supporting function added, creates 
  a membership vector from a community structure merge tree

New in the R interface
----------------------

- as the internal representation changed, graphs stored with 'save' 
  with an older igraph version cannot be read back with the new
  version reliably.
- neighbors returns ordered lists

- VF2 isomorphism algorithm
- support for reading graphs from the Graph Database for isomorphism
- girth calculation added, thanks to Keith Briggs
- support for reading and writing GML files

  thanks to Aaron Clauset for sharing his code

  community detection algorithms added

- graphics parameter handling is completely rewritten, uniform handling 
  of colors and fonts, make sure you read ?igraph.plotting
- new plotting parameter for edges: arrow.mode
- a bug corrected when playing a nonlinear barabasi.game
- better looking plotting in 3d using rglplot: edges are 3d too
- rglplot layout is allowed to be two dimensional now
- rglplot suspends updates while drawing, this makes it faster
- loop edges are correctly plotted by all three plotting functions

- better printing of attributes when printing graphs
- summary of a graph prints attribute names
- is.igraph rewritten to make it possible to inherit from the 'igraph' class
- somewhat better looking progress meter for functions which support it

Others
------

- proper support for Debian packages (re)added
- many functions benefit from the new internal representation and are 
  faster now: transitivity, reciprocity, graph operator functions like 
  intersection and union, etc.
- igraph compiles with Microsoft Visual C++ now
- there were some internal changes to make igraph a real graph algorithm
  platform in the near future, but these are undocumented now

Bugs corrected
--------------

- corrected a bug when reading Pajek files: directed graphs were read as undirected

==================================

Debian Linux users can now install and update the C interface
using the standard package manager. Just add the following two
lines to /etc/apt/sources.list and install the libigraph and
libigraph-dev packages. Packages for the Python interface are
coming soon.

  igraph_st_mincut_value, igraph_mincut_value, the Stoer-Wagner
  algorithm is implemented for undirected graphs
- vertex connectivity functions, usually based on maximum flow:
  igraph_st_vertex_connectivity, igraph_vertex_connectivity
- edge connectivity functions, usually based on maximum flow:
  igraph_st_edge_connectivity, igraph_edge_connectivity

  Stefan Bornholdt algorithm added: igraph_spinglass_community,
  igraph_spinglass_my_community
- igraph_extended_chordal_rings, it creates extended chordal rings
- 'no' argument added to igraph_clusters, it is possible to calculate
  the number of clusters without calculating the clusters themselves
- minimum spanning tree functions keep attributes now and also the 
  direction of the edges is kept in directed graphs
- there are separate functions to calculate different types of
  transitivity now
- igraph_delete_vertices rewritten to allocate less memory for the new
  graph 
- neighborhood related functions added: igraph_neighborhood,
  igraph_neighborhood_size, igraph_neighborhood_graphs
- two new games added based on different node types:
  igraph_preference_game and igraph_asymmetric_preference_game
- Laplacian of a graph can be calculated by the igraph_laplacian function

Changes in the R interface
--------------------------

- bonpow function ported from SNA to calculate Bonacich power centrality
- get.adjacency supports attributes now, this means that it sets the
  colnames  and rownames attributes and can return attribute values in
  the matrix instead of 0/1
- grg.game, geometric random graphs
- graph.density, graph density calculation
- edge and vertex attributes can be added easily now when added new
  edges with add.edges or new vertices with add.vertices
- graph.data.frame creates graph from data frames, this can be used to 
  create graphs with edge attributes easily
- plot.igraph and tkplot can plot self-loop edges now
- graph.edgelist to create a graph from an edge list, can also handle 
  edge lists with symbolic names
- get.edgelist has now a 'names' argument and can return symbolic
  vertex names instead of vertex ids, by default id uses the 'name'
  vertex attribute is returned 
- printing graphs on screen also prints symbolic symbolic names
  (the 'name' attribute if present)
- maximum flow and minimum cut functions: graph.maxflow, graph.mincut
- vertex and edge connectivity: edge.connectivity, vertex.connectivity
- edge and vertex disjoint paths: edge.disjoint.paths, 
  vertex.disjoint.paths
- White's cohesion and adhesion measure: graph.adhesion, graph.cohesion
- dimacs file format added
- as.directed handles attributes now
- constraint corrected, it handles weighted graphs as well now
- weighted attribute to graph.adjacency

  neighborhood.size, graph.neighborhood

  asymmetric.preference.game

Bugs corrected
--------------

  libxml2 library

  Laplacian is requested

Released Aug 23, 2006

This is a bug-fix release. Bugs fixed:
- igraph_reciprocity (reciprocity in R) corrected to avoid segfaults
- some docs updates
- various R package updated to make it conform to the CRAN rules

=========
igraph 0.2
=========

Released Aug 18, 2006

Release time at last! There are many new things in igraph 0.2, the
most important ones:
- reading writing Pajek and GraphML formats with attributes
  (not all Pajek and GraphML files are supported, see documentation
  for details)
- iterators totally rewritten, it is much faster and cleaner now
- the RANDEDU fast motif search algorithm is implemented
- many new graph generators, both games and regular graphs
- many new structural properties: transitivity, reciprocity, etc.
- graph operators: union, intersection, difference, structural holes, etc.
- conversion between directed and undirected graphs
- new layout algorithms for trees and large graphs, 3D layouts
and many more.

New things in the R package:
- support for CTRL+C
- new functions: Graph Laplacian, Burt's constraint, etc.
- vertex/edge sequences totally rewritten, smart indexing (see manual)
- new R manual and tutorial: `Network Analysis with igraph', still 
  under development but useful
- very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL

Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.

====================
igraph mailing lists
====================

Aug 18, 2006

I've set up two igraph mailing lists: igraph-help for
general igraph questions and discussion and
igraph-anonunce for announcements. See 
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help and
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce
for subscription information, archives, etc.

=========
igraph 0.1
=========

Released Jan 30, 2006

After about a year of development this is the first "official" release 
of the igraph library. This release should be considered as beta 
software, but it should be useful in general. Please send your 
questions and comments.
