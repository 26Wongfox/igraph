igraph 0.2.1
=========

Released Aug 23, 2006

This is a bug-fix release. Bugs fixed:
- igraph_reciprocity (reciprocity in R) corrected to avoid segfaults
- some docs updates
- various R package updated to make it conform to the CRAN rules

igraph 0.2
=========

Released Aug 18, 2006

Release time at last! There are many new things in igraph 0.2, the
most important ones:
- reading writing Pajek and GraphML formats with attributes
  (not all Pajek and GraphML files are supported, see documentation
  for details)
- iterators totally rewritten, it is much faster and cleaner now
- the RANDEDU fast motif search algorithm is implemented
- many new graph generators, both games and regular graphs
- many new structural properties: transitivity, reciprocity, etc.
- graph operators: union, intersection, difference, structural holes, etc.
- conversion between directed and undirected graphs
- new layout algorithms for trees and large graphs, 3D layouts
and many more.

New things in the R package:
- support for CTRL+C
- new functions: Graph Laplacian, Burt's constraint, etc.
- vertex/edge sequences totally rewritten, smart indexing (see manual)
- new R manual and tutorial: `Network Analysis with igraph', still 
  under development but useful
- very basic 3D plotting using OpenGL

Although this release was somewhat tested on Linux, MS Windows, Mac
OSX, Solaris 8 and FreeBSD, no heavy testing was done, so it might
contain bugs, and we kindly ask you to send bug reports to make igraph
better.

igraph mailing lists
====================

Aug 18, 2006

I've set up two igraph mailing lists: igraph-help for
general igraph questions and discussion and
igraph-anonunce for announcements. See 
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help and
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-announce
for subscription information, archives, etc.

igraph 0.1
=========

Released Jan 30, 2006

After about a year of development this is the first "official" release 
of the igraph library. This release should be considered as beta 
software, but it should be useful in general. Please send your 
questions and comments.
