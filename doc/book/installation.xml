<title>Installation</title>

<para>
The &igraph; R package can be installed just like any other R
packages. Perhaps the easiest way is to use the
<command>install.packages()</command> command. This downloads either a
source of binary package appropriate for the running system from CRAN
and installs it by default to the system directories. The package can
be loaded by typing 
<informalexample><programlisting>
library(igraph)
</programlisting></informalexample>
after installation.
</para>

<para> 
If the user doesn't have rights to write to system directories the
<parameter>lib</parameter> argument of the
<command>install.packages()</command> command can be used to set an
alternate installation directory. It is good R practice to keep the
user's privately installed packages in a separate directory (say
<filename>~/.R/library</filename>), if this is the case &igraph; can
be installed like this:
<informalexample><programlisting>
install.packages("igraph", lib="~/.R/library")
</programlisting></informalexample>
The R package search path needs to be modified as well to let R know
about our private package directory:
<informalexample><programlisting>
.libPaths( c("~/.R/library", .libPaths()) )
</programlisting></informalexample>
This command can also be added to the <filename>~/.Rprofile</filename>
file to set the search path automatically every time you start R.

See <command>?Startup</command> and <command>?.libPaths()</command>
for more information about R's startup mechanism and the way
directories are searched for packages and
<command>?install.packages</command> about installing R packages.
