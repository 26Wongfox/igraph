<title>Importing and Exporting Graphs</title>

<para>
The &igraph; library and the &igraph; R package do not introduce a new
file format to store graphs. Instead if recommends using the GraphML
format for smaller graphs and some simple edge list format for larger
graphs, perhaps also complessed.
</para>

<para>
&igraph; provides the <function>read.graph()</function> and
<function>write.graph()</function> functions for reading and writing
graphs from and to files. Both of these functions can handle a number
of different file formats, which can be selected by the
<parameter>format</parameter> argument.
</para>

<para>
Note however that you don't neccessarily need special &igraph;
functions to read and write graphs in various formats, as there is a
wealth of R functions for importing and exporting data in a variety of
formats. For example you can use the standard R
<function>scan()</function> to read an edge list from a file
and then <function>graph()</function> to create a graph object from
it. Similarly you can use <function>get.edgelist()</function> to
create an edge list from a graph object and the standard
<function>write()</function> to export it to a file.
</para>

<para>
As R can also import Excel files via the <filename>.csv</filename>
file format, Excel files can also easily converted to &igraph; graph
objects; just like nearly any other format.
</para>

<para>
Another possiblity to store graph data in files is to use the
<function>save()</function> and <function>load()</function> functions
as provided by R. Graph objects can be safely saved and loaded this
way. </para>

<section><title>Simple formats</title>

<para>
Simple formats can tipically store the structure of a graph but no
or just limited amount of meta-data like edge weights, vertex colors,
etc.
</para>

<section><title>Edge List Files</title>

<para>
Perhaps the simplest file format &igraph; can handle is the edge
list format. This is nothing more than a simple text file with two
whitespace separated columns containing vertex ids (ie. non-negative
numbers). 
So if the <filename>graph.txt</filename> contains the following
edge list:
<screen>
0 1
2 3
3 2
1 0
</screen>
then it can be read by setting the <parameter>format</parameter>
argument to <constant>edgelist</constant>:
<informalexample><programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>read.graph("graph.txt", format="edgelist")
</programlisting>
<screen>
Vertices: 4 
Edges: 4 
Directed: TRUE 

Edges:
[0] 0 -> 1
[1] 2 -> 3
[2] 3 -> 2
[3] 1 -> 0
</screen>
</informalexample>
<function>read.graph()</function> has an optional
<parameter>directed</parameter> argument, set this to
<constant>FALSE</constant> to create an undirected graph, the
default is directed. There is also an optional
<parameter>n</parameter> argument, this is the number of vertices in
the graph. Set this to the desired value if it is bigger than the
highest vertex id in the edge list file. (If it is set to a smaller
value then it will be ignored.)
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Large Graph Layout Formats</title>

<para>
These two formats were introduced by the Large Graph Layout
program, they are abre to store edge weights and symbolic vertex
names. See also 
<ulink url="http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl">the LGL
homepage</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
The <constant>ncol</constant> format is simply a weighted edge list
with symbolic vertex names. The vertex names and the weight are
separaeted by white space, the vertex names themselves cannot contain
white space. The weights are optional. The vertex names are stored in
the vertex attribute <constant>name</constant>, the edge weights are
stored in the edge attribute <constant>weight</constant>. You may set
the <parameter>names</parameter> and/or <parameter>weights</parameter>
optional arguments to <constant>FALSE</constant> if you don't want to
set these attributes.
</para>

<para>
If the file <filename>graph.ncol</filename> contains
the following graph:
<screen>
foo    bar 1
bar    baz -1
foobar foo 
foo    baz 2
</screen>
then we get the following graph object:
<informalexample><programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>g &lt;- read.graph("graph.ncol", format="ncol")
<prompt>> </prompt>g
</programlisting>
<screen>
Vertices: 4 
Edges: 4 
Directed: FALSE 

Edges:
[0] 0 -- 1
[1] 1 -- 2
[2] 0 -- 3
[3] 0 -- 2
</screen>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>V(g)$name
</programlisting>
<screen>
[1] "foo"    "bar"    "baz"    "foobar"
</screen>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>E(g)$weight
</programlisting>
<screen>
[1]  1 -1  0  2
</screen>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>The other LGL format is the <constant>lgl</constant>
format. This is adjacency list like format, it might contain symbolic
vertex names and optionally edge weights: 
<screen>
# vertex1name
vertex2name [optionalWeight]
vertex3name [optionalWeight]
</screen>
This is similar to an adjacency list format, the neighboring vertices
for each vertex are listed. The name of the initial vertex is preceded
by <quote>#</quote>, then in the following lines the names of its
neighbors are listed optionally with the weights of the edges.
</para>

<para>
The LGL software works with undirected graphs containing no multiple
edges, this means that if vertex <quote>B</quote> is listed as a
neighbor of vertex <quote>A</quote> then vertex <quote>A</quote> must
not be listed as a neighbor of vertex <quote>B</quote>. &igraph; of
course is happy with multiple edges and is able to read and write
<constant>lgl</constant> files which break the original LGL software.
</para>

</section>

</section>

<section><title>The Pajek format</title>
<para>Pajek it a popular network analysis program for Windows. (See
the <ulink url="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/"> Pajek
hompage</ulink>.) It has a quite flexible but not very well documented
file format, see the Pajek manual on the Pajek homepage for some
information about the file format.
</para>

<para>
&igraph; can read and write Pajek files, with some limitations:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>
    Only <constant>.net</constant> files are supported, Pajek project
    files (which can contain many graph and also other type of data)
    are not. Poject files might be supported in a forthcoming &igraph;
    release if they turned out to be needed.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Time events networks are not supported.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Hypergraphs (graphs with non-binary edges) are not supported as
    &igraph; cannot handle them.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Graphs containing both directed and undirected edges are not
    supported as &igraph; cannot represent them.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Bipartite (also called affiliation) networks are not
    supported. The surrent &igraph; version imports the network
    structure correctly but vertex type information is omitted.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Graph with multiple edge sets are not supported
  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
&igraph; also reads the non-structural information from Pajek files,
like edge weights and vertex colors and assign these as vertex and
edge attributes. Note however that the names of the attributes are not
always the same as in the Pajek file, some of them are renamed to
be more informative, or other reasons. The following table contains
the vertex attributes created by &igraph;:

<para>
These &igraph; attributes are only created if there is at least one
vertex in the Pajek file which has the corresponding associated
information. Eg. if there are vertex coordinates for at least one
vertex then the <quote>x</quote>, <quote>y</quote> and possibly also
<quote>z</quote> vertex attributes will be created. For those vertices
for which the attribute is not defined, <constant>NaN</constant> is
assigned.

<para>
When writing a Pajek file with <function>write.graph()</function> the
vertex and edge attributes in the previous two tables are written to
the file if they're present in the graph.
</para>

<para>
The Pajek file format is included in &igraph; to allow users to
convert their Pajek files to formats more suitable for &igraph;, like
GraphML for example. The Pajek format is not intended to be used as a
standard file format of &igraph; because of the lack of proper
documentation. 
</para>

</section>

<section><title>The GraphML format</title>

<para>GraphML is an XML-based file format (an XML application in the
XML terminology) to describe graphs. It is a modern format, and can
store graphs with an extensible set of vertex and edge attributes, and
generalized graphs which &igraph; cannot handle. Thus &igraph;
supports only a subset of the GraphML language:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>
    Hypergraphs are not supported.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Nested graphs are not supported.
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    Mixed graphs, ie. graphs with both directed and undirected edges
    are not supported. <function>read.graph()</function> sets the
    graph directed if this is the default in the GraphML file, even if
    all the edges are in fact undirected.
  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>A detailed example</title>

<para>
This section show a detailed example on how to convert your data into
an igraph graph.
</para>

<para>Suppose you're just back from your field research or you've
found some nice piece of data online and you want to turn your data
into an igraph graph object to play with it. Although we cannot give a
general receipt which works in all cases, the following example should
provide you enough guidelines to handle almost any type of data you'll
find.</para>

<para>
If your data is not in an electronic format, then you need to type it
in into one or more files first. This can be done by any basic editor
you are familiar with, for example notepad or wordpad on Microsoft
operating systems, emacs or vi on Unix-like systems. You can also use
a speadsheet program if you like but make sure that it can export CSV
(comma separated value) files.
</para>

<para>
You can also type in your data directly into R, in the first example
we will show you how this can be done.
</para>

<para> Let us suppose that you've colledted information about the
social network of a small group, say ten people. You want to store
various attributes of the people and different types of relations
(like friendship, business relationship, etc.) among them. You decide
to store everything in a single graph, for simplicity.
</para>

<para>
The following traits are collected about the people in the
experiment: name, age, gender and R will assign numeric ids to them.
Here is the complete data set:

Let us assume that this data is save to a file in CSV format, this
simply means that the entries in the table are separated by commas.
The first file (<filename>traits.csv</filename>) contains the traits
and looks like this:
<screen>
Alice Anderson,    48, F
Bob Bradford,      33, M
Cecil Connor,      45, F
David Daugher,     34, M
Esmeralda Escobar, 21, F
Frank Finley,      36, M
Gabi Garbo,        44, F
Helen Hunt,        40, F
Iris Irving,       25, F
James Jones,       47, M
</screen> and the second file which contains the relations looks like
this:
<screen>
Bob,       Alice,     N, 4, 4
Cecil,     Bob,       N, 5, 5
Cecil,     Alice,     Y, 5, 5
David,     Alice,     N, 2, 4
David,     Bob,       N, 1, 2
Esmeralda, Alice,     Y, 1, 3
...
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Let us now import this data into R and create an igraph graph from it. 
First we will import the data into data frames. (If you don't know
what data frames are, don't worry you'll still survice this section,
but it might worth to consult the R tutorial. For now the important
thing is that a data frame is like a table.) The command
<function>read.csv()</function> can read a CSV file and stores the
data in a data frame:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>traits &lt;- read.csv("traits.csv", head=FALSE)
<prompt>> </prompt>rel &lt;- read.csv("relations.csv", head=FALSE)
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
The <parameter>head</parameter> parameter is set to
<constant>FALSE</constant>, this instructs R not to interpret the
first line of the file as a header. Set this to
<constant>TRUE</constant> (or omit the parameter) if you have a header
with column names in your file.
</para>

<para>
We will first create an empty graph with ten vertices and the traits
as vertex attributes. This can be done with a single command after
loading the package:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>library(igraph)
<prompt>> </prompt>g &lt;- graph.empty()
<prompt>> </prompt>g &lt;- add.vertices(g, nrow(traits), 
                     name=as.character(traits[,1]), age=traits[,2],
                     gender=as.character(traits[,3]))
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
We can check that the graph is created properly:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>V(g)$name
</programlisting>
<screen>
 [1] "Alice Anderson"    "Bob Bradford"      "Cecil Connor"     
 [4] "David Daugher"     "Esmeralda Escobar" "Frank Finley"     
 [7] "Gabi Garbo"        "Helen Hunt"        "Iris Irving"      
[10] "James Jones"
</screen>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>V(g)$age
</programlisting>
<screen>
 [1] 48 33 45 34 21 36 44 40 25 47
</screen>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>V(g)$gender
</programlisting>
<screen>
 [1] "F" "M" "F" "M" "F" "M" "F" "F" "F" "M"
</screen>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
Now we continue by adding the edges. First we need to cut the first
names from the full names, since the edges are given with the first
names only. If you want to spare this step use the same names in both
files. 
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>names &lt;- sapply(strsplit(V(g)$name, " "), "[",1)
<prompt>> </prompt>ids &lt;- 1:length(names)-1
<prompt>> </prompt>names(ids) &lt;- names
<prompt>> </prompt>ids
</programlisting>
<screen>
    Alice       Bob     Cecil     David Esmeralda     Frank      Gabi     Helen
        0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7
     Iris     James 
        8         9 
</screen>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
Then, we create an edge list with vertex ids instead of symbolic
names:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>from &lt;- as.character(rel[,1])
<prompt>> </prompt>to &lt;- as.character(rel[,2])
<prompt>> </prompt>edges &lt;- matrix(c(ids[from], ids[to]), nc=2)
<prompt>> </prompt>edges
</programlisting>
<screen>
      [,1] [,2]
 [1,]    1    0
 [2,]    2    1
 [3,]    2    0
 [4,]    3    0
 [5,]    3    1
 [6,]    4    0
 [7,]    5    0
 [8,]    5    4
 [9,]    6    1
[10,]    6    0
[11,]    7    0
[12,]    8    2
[13,]    8    1
[14,]    8    4
[15,]    9    0
[16,]    9    1
[17,]    9    6
[18,]    0    1
[19,]    1    2
[20,]    0    2
[21,]    0    3
[22,]    1    3
[23,]    0    4
[24,]    0    5
[25,]    4    5
[26,]    1    6
[27,]    0    6
[28,]    0    7
[29,]    2    8
[30,]    1    8
[31,]    4    8
[32,]    0    9
[33,]    1    9
[34,]    6    9
</screen>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
And finally we can add the edges together with their attributes:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>g &lt;- add.edges(g, t(edges), 
               room=as.character(rel[,3]),
	       friend=rel[,4], advice=rel[,5])
<prompt>> </prompt>g
</programlisting>
<screen>
Vertices: 10 
Edges: 34 
Directed: TRUE 

Edges:
[0] 1 -> 0
[1] 2 -> 1
[2] 2 -> 0
[3] 3 -> 0
[4] 3 -> 1
[5] 4 -> 0
[6] 5 -> 0
[7] 5 -> 4
[8] 6 -> 1
[9] 6 -> 0
[10] 7 -> 0
[11] 8 -> 2
[12] 8 -> 1
[13] 8 -> 4
[14] 9 -> 0
[15] 9 -> 1
[16] 9 -> 6
[17] 0 -> 1
[18] 1 -> 2
[19] 0 -> 2
[20] 0 -> 3
[21] 1 -> 3
[22] 0 -> 4
[23] 0 -> 5
[24] 4 -> 5
[25] 1 -> 6
[26] 0 -> 6
[27] 0 -> 7
[28] 2 -> 8
[29] 1 -> 8
[30] 4 -> 8
[31] 0 -> 9
[32] 1 -> 9
[33] 6 -> 9
</screen>
</informalexample>
</para>

<para>
You can find the whole program creating the graph in file
<ulink url="import.R"><filename>import.R</filename></ulink>.
</para>

<para>
Finally we can create a nice plot of the graph, with the edges
connecting people working in the same room colored red.
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
<prompt>> </prompt>E(g)$color &lt;- "black"
<prompt>> </prompt>E(g)[ room=="y" ]$color &lt;- "red"
<prompt>> </prompt>tkplot(g, layout=layout.kamada.kawai, edge.color=E(g)$color)
</programlisting>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="import.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject>
<imageobject><imagedata fileref="import.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
