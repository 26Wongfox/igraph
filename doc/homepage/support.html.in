<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>There are two <b>igraph</b> mailing lists: <code>igraph-help</code>
  and <code>igraph-announce</code>.
</p>

<h3><code>igraph-help</code></h3>

<p><code>igraph-help</code> is for general discussion and questions,
  help, suggestions, etc. See
  <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/igraph-help"
     onClick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outgoing/mailinglist-help'); ">
    its page at Savannah</a> for subscription and archives.
</p>

<h3><code>igraph-announce</code></h3>

<p><code>igraph-announce</code> is a very low-traffic mailing (about
  two emails per year) list for important announcements only, such as
  a new <b>igraph</b> release for example. These announcements are
  also sent to <code>igraph-help</code>, so you don't need to sign up
  to both mailing lists.
</p>

<p><code>igraph-announce</code> is a read-only list, you can 
  not post any messages to it.
