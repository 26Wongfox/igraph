<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>igraph</b> is a free software package for creating and manipulating undirected and 
directed graphs. It includes implementations for classic graph theory
problems like minimum spanning trees and network flow, and also
implements algorithms for some recent network analysis methods, like 
community structure search.</p>

<p>The efficient implementation of <b>igraph</b> allows it to handle graphs
with millions of vertices and edges. The rule of thumb is that if your graph
fits into the physical memory then <b>igraph</b> can handle it.</p>

<p><b>igraph</b> can be installed in several forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>igraph</b> as a <i>C library</i> is useful if you want to use
    it in your C/C++ projects, or want to implement your own network analysis
    or model in C/C++ using the data structures and functions <b>igraph</b> provides.
    </li>
<li><b>igraph</b> as an <i>R package</i>. You can use <b>igraph</b> as an extension 
    package to <a href="http://www.r-project.org">The GNU R project for
    Statistical Computing.</a> The flexibility of the R language and its 
    richness in statistical methods add a great deal of productivity to 
    <b>igraph</b>, with a very small speed penalty.</li>
<li><b>igraph</b> as a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> extension module.
    This way you can combine <b>igraph</b> with the huge set of Python functions
    and modules available, and the ease of the Python language,
    with a small speed penalty.</li>
<li><b>igraph</b> as a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> extension. 
    If you like the Ruby language, then this might be the right choice for you.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Every form of <b>igraph</b> contain the same code at the very heart, written in ANSI C.</p>

<p>Please note that the ways of installing <b>igraph</b> depends on which its 
forms you actually want to use. Eg. for using <b>igraph</b> as an R package,
you don't need to download the C library at all. See the <a
href="download.html">download page</a> for details.</p>
