<h2>igraph 0.5.2 Release Notes</h2>

<p class="news">
  This is another bug fix release, with a couple of new features. Here
  are the important ones. See the <a href="news.html">news page</a> for
  the complete list of changes.

  Bipartite graphs</h3>

<p class="news">
Bipartite graphs have two kinds of vertices and edges are only allowed
to connect opposite kinds. Think of the Hollywood movie graph with
actors and movies. igraph 0.5.2 now contains some functions to deal
with these kind of networks.

  The label propagation community finding algorithm</h3>

<p class="news">
This is a simple and intuitive community finding algorithm, published
by Raghavan et al. in 2007 (see docs for full citation). It works by
assigning labels to the vertices and then updating the labels based on
majority voting among the neighbors.

  3D version of the DrL layout generator</h3>

<p class="news">
The DrL layout generator was extended to generate three dimensional
layouts. Albeit slower than the regular 2D version, this is a nice
addition for those who do visualization in 3D.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/>
  (Limited) R GUI</h3>

<p class="news">
A minimal, supported GUI is included now in the R package. It contains
only a small fraction of igraph capabilities, but can be still useful,
e.g. in teaching. You can start it by typing <code>tkigraph()</code>,
after loading the igraph package of course.

  Johnson's shortest path algorithm</h3>

<p class="news">
Johnson's algorithm is a good choice for finding all shortest paths in
a network that has some negative edge weights, but no negative
cycles.
</p>

  Average nearest neighbor degree</h3>

<p class="news">
A new function was added to calculate the average degree of the
neighbors of all or some vertices. It supports the edge weighted
version of the measure as well.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/>
  Curved edges in R plots</h3>

<p class="news">
Both <code>plot()</code> and <code>tkplot()</code> supports curved
edges. See <code>?igraph.plotting</code> for more details.

  Several bugs and memory leaks corrected</h3>

<p>
See the <a href="news.html">news page</a> for
the complete list of changes. Apart from the bug fixes, some functions
were rewritten to speed them up.
