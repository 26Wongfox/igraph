<h2>igraph 0.6 Release Notes</h2>

<p class="news">
igraph 0.6 is a major new release of igraph. It contains many new
features and major changes, a lot of bug fixes and improvements. 
As always, we are grateful to the people who sent comments, bug 
reports, questions, and specially to people who contributed code.
</p>

<p class="news">
See below a list of major changes, with links to the relevant sections
of the documentation. New features in R (look for the
<img src="images/icon_r.png"/> logo), 
<img src="images/icon_python.png"/> Python, and
<img src="images/icon_c.png"/> C are all listed here.
</p>

<p class="news">
See the <a href="news.html">news page</a> for a (more) complete list
of changes.

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />
  <img src="images/icon_python.png" />
  The Nexus repository</h3>

<p class="news">
igraph supports the <a href="http://nexus.igraph.org">Nexus network
    repository</a> from R and from Python. Nexus is an online database
of network data sets. You can search Nexus and download network from
it directly from R and Python. See the <a href="doc-0.6/R/nexus.html">R
    manual</a> or the <a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.nexus.NexusConnection-class.html">Python documentation</a> for details.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />Numbering from 1 in R</h3>

<p class="news">
The biggest change in the R interface is that starting from this version
vertices and edges are numbered from one. This change might be
painful for many people, because it makes already existing code
incompatible with igraph 0.6. To make the switch easier, there is now an
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph0/index.html">
igraph0</a> package on CRAN; igraph0 uses 0-based vertex and
edge ids, and it can be used to run old code. Note, however, that
igraph0 will not be developed in the future. Please use the 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html">
igraph</a> package for current and future work.
</p>

<p class="news">
(Also note that in Python and C vertices and edges are still numbered
from zero, as these languages traditionally use zero-based indexing.)
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_python.png" />Support for Python 3.x</h3>

<p class="news">
The Python interface of igraph now supports Python 3. The current release was
tested with Python 3.2 on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Please report any bugs
you encounter when using igraph in Python 3.x through the
<a href="bugs.html">usual channels</a>.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_c.png"/>
  <img src="images/icon_r.png"/>
  <img src="images/icon_python.png"/>Community detection improvements</h3>

<p class="news">
Community structure detection via exact modularity optimization. As
modularity optimization in an NP-complete problem, this works only for
small graphs.

</p>

<p class="news">

'<code>communities</code>' object now. We have defined various
operations for these objects, see the
<a href="doc-0.6/R/communities.html">R manual</a> for more.

<h3><img src="images/icon_c.png"/>
  <img src="images/icon_r.png"/>
  <img src="images/icon_python.png"/>Maximum matchings in bipartite graphs</h3>

<p class="news">
Igraph now implements the push-relabel algorithm and the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm
(also known as the Hungarian method) to find maximum matchings in unweighted and
weighted bipartite graphs. See
the <a href="doc-0.6/html/ch13s18.html">C

</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />Hiding the graph structure by
  default</h3>

<p class="news">
In R, if you type in the name of an igraph object, the edges of the 
graph are not dumped to the screen any more, only a short summary of
the graph is printed:
<pre>
      > karate
      IGRAPH UNW- 34 78 -- Zachary's karate club network
      + attr: name (g/c), Citation (g/c), Author (g/c), Faction (v/n), name (v/c), weight (e/n)
</pre> 

<p class="news">
To see the graph structure, you can use the '<code>str()</code>' function.
See more in the <a href="doc-0.6/R/print.graph.html">R
    documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_python.png" />Named graph vertices</h3>

<p class="news">
The Python interface now treats the '<code>name</code>' attributes in a special way.
The values of the attribute are indexed in the background, allowing the retrieval of
a vertex with a given name in amortized constant time. Furthermore, most of the
graph query methods accept vertex names as well as vertex indices.
See the <a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.VertexSeq-class.html#find">Python documentation</a>
for more information.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_python.png" />Pretty-printed graph summaries</h3>

<p class="news">
The same graph summary format used by R is now also adopted by Python.
Printing a graph with the <code>print</code> statement now prints the
summary and the edge list in a concise format:
<pre>
	>>> print karate
	IGRAPH UNW- 34 78 -- Zachary's karate club network
	+ attr: Author (g), Citation (g), name (g), Faction (v), id (v), name(v),
	  weight (e)
	+ edges (vertex names):
	    Mr Hi -- Actor 2, Actor 3, Actor 4, Actor 5, ...
	  Actor 2 -- Mr Hi, Actor 3, Actor 4, ...
	...
</pre>

<p class="news"> Printing a graph with the <code>summary()</code> function (in
the igraph namespace) prints the short summary only, without the edge list:</p>
<pre>
    >>> summary(karate)
	IGRAPH UNW- 34 78 -- Zachary's karate club network
	+ attr: Author (g), Citation (g), name (g), Faction (v), id (v), name(v),
	  weight (e)
</pre>

<p class="news">Printing a graph with <code>summary(graph, full=True)</code> prints
the summary, the edge list, the vertex and the edge attributes as well.</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" /><img src="images/icon_python.png" />Easier manipulation of graphs</h3>

<p class="news">
In R, there are now new and easier ways to add new vertices/edges to a
graph, or remove existing ones. See the details in the 
<a href="doc-0.6/R/graph.structure.html">R documentation</a>. In Python,
you can treat the graph as a virtual adjacency matrix. See the details in
the <a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.Graph-class.html">Python
	documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />The '<code>igraphdata</code>' package</h3>

<p class="news">
The new R package 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraphdata/index.html">
igraphdata</a> contains some example graph data sets.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/><img src="images/icon_python.png"/>Mark groups of vertices in R and Python plots</h3>

<p class="news">
In R and Python, you can mark vertex groups on graph plots, using shaded
areas. Communities and cohesive blocks are plotted using technique by
default. See the '<code>mark.groups</code>' argument of
the <a href="doc-0.6/R/plot.graph.html">'<code>plot.igraph()</code>'</a>
function in R and the '<code>mark_groups</code>' argument of the
<a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.Graph-class.html#__plot__"><code>Graph.__plot__</code></a>
function in Python.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_python.png"/>Refactored graph drawers in the Python interface</h3>

<p class="news">
Graphs in the Python interface are plotted by graph drawer classes now instead
of a monolithic plotting function. This allows one to replace the
<a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.drawing.graph.DefaultGraphDrawer-class.html">default
	graph drawer</a> with custom graph drawers; for instance, a drawer that
sends an igraph graph to an
<a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.drawing.graph.UbiGraphDrawer-class.html">UbiGraph display</a>
or to
<a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.drawing.graph.CytoscapeGraphDrawer-class.html">Cytoscape</a>.
The default graph drawer also allows the partial customization of the plot with
pluggable <a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.drawing.shapes-module.html">vertex shapes</a>
and <a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.drawing.edge-module.html">edge drawers</a>.</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/>igraph demos in the R package</h3>

<p class="news">
We have included some demos in the igraph R package, to get a list of
the demos, type this at your R prompt:
<pre>
      > demo(package="igraph")
      Demos in package ‘igraph’:

      centrality              Classic and other vertex centrality indices
      cohesive                Cohesive blocking, the Moody & White method
      community               Community structure detection
      crashR                  A crash-course into R
      smallworld              Small-world networks
</pre>
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/>
  <img src="images/icon_python.png"/>
  Better handling of attributes in R and Python</h3>

<p class="news">
In R and Python, many igraph functions keep the vertex, edge and graph attributes
now, when one manipulates the graph. The attributes can also be
combined using a flexible API. See
the <a href="doc-0.6/R/attribute.combination.html">R manual</a> and the 
'<code>combine_edges</code>' and '<code>combine_attrs</code>' arguments
of many graph methods in the <a href="doc-0.6/python/igraph.Graph-class.html">Python documentation</a> for more.
