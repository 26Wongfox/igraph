<h2>igraph 0.6 Release Notes</h2>

<p class="news">
igraph 0.6 is a major new release of igraph. It contains many new
features and major changes, a lot of bug fixes and improvements. 
As always, we are grateful to the people who sent comments, bug 
reports, questions, and specially to people who contributed code.
</p>

<p class="news">
See below a list of major changes, with links to the relevant sections
of the documentation. New features in R (look for the
<img src="images/icon_r.png"/> logo), 
<img src="images/icon_python.png"/> Python, and
<img src="images/icon_c.png"/> C are all listed here.
</p>

<p class="news">
See the <a href="news.html">news page</a> for a (more) complete list
of changes.

  <img src="images/icon_python.png" />
  The Nexus repository</h3>

<p class="news">
igraph supports the <a href="http://nexus.igraph.org">Nexus network
    repository</a> from R and from Python. Nexus is an online database
of network data sets. You can search Nexus and download network from
it directly from R and Python. See the <a href="doc-0.6/R/nexus.html">R
    manual</a> or the <a href="TODO">Python manual</a> for details.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />Numbering from 1 in R</h3>

<p class="news">
The biggest change in the R interface is that starting from this version
vertices and edges are numbered from one. This change might be
painful for many people, because it makes already existing code
incompatible with igraph 0.6. To make the switch easier, there is now an
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph0/index.html">
igraph0</a> package on CRAN; igraph0 uses 0-based vertex and
edge ids, and it can be used to run old code. Note, however, that
igraph0 will not be developed in the future. Please use the 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html">
igraph</a> package for current and future work.
</p>

<p class="news">
(Also note that in Python and C vertices and edges are still numbered
from zero, as these languages traditionally use zero-based indexing.)

    Reference manual</a>, the 
<a href="doc-0.6/R/cohesive.blocks.html">R documentation</a>, or
the <a href="TODO">Python manual</a>.
</p>

<p class="news">
In R, all community detection functions return a
'<code>communities</code>' object now. We have defined various
operations for these objects, see the
<a href="doc-0.6/R/communities.html">R manual</a> for more.

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />Hiding the graph structure by
  default</h3>

<p class="news">
In R, if you type in the name of an igraph object, the edges of the 
graph are not dumped to the screen any more, only a short summary of
the graph is printed:
<pre>
      > karate
      IGRAPH UNW- 34 78 -- Zachary's karate club network
      + attr: name (g/c), Citation (g/c), Author (g/c), Faction (v/n), name (v/c), weight (e/n)
</pre> 

<p class="news">
To see the graph structure, you can use the '<code>str()</code>' function.
See more in the <a href="doc-0.6/R/print.graph.html">R
    documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />Easier manipulation of graphs</h3>

<p class="news">
In R, there are now new and easier ways to add new vertices/edges to a
graph, or remove existing ones. See the details in the 
<a href="doc-0.6/R/graph.structure.html">R documentation</a>.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />The '<code>igraphdata</code>' package</h3>

<p class="news">
The new R package 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraphdata/index.html">
igraphdata</a> contains some example graph data sets.
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/>Mark groups of vertices in R plots</h3>

<p class="news">
In R you can mark vertex groups on graph plots, using shaded
areas. Communities and cohesive blocks are plotted using technique by
default. See the '<code>mark.groups</code>' argument of
the <a href="doc-0.6/R/plot.graph.html">'<code>plot.igraph()</code>'</a>
function. 
</p>

<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png"/>igraph demos in the R package</h3>

<p class="news">
We have included some demos in the igraph R package, to get a list of
the demos, type this at your R prompt:
<pre>
      > demo(package="igraph")
      Demos in package ‘igraph’:

      centrality              Classic and other vertex centrality indices

  Better handling of attributes in R and Python</h3>

<p class="news">
In R, many igraph functions keep the vertex, edge and graph attributes
now, when one manipulates the graph. The attributes can also be
combined using a flexible API. See
the <a href="doc-0.6/R/attribute.combination.html">R manual</a> and the 
<a href="doc-0.6/Python/TODO">Python manual</a> for more.
