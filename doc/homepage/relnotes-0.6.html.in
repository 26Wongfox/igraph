<h3><img src="images/icon_r.png" />Numbering from 1 in R</h3>

<p class="news">
The biggest change in the R interface is that starting from this version
vertices and edges are numbered from one. This change might be
painful for many people, because it makes already existing code
incompatible with igraph 0.6. To make the switch easier, there is now an
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph0/index.html">
igraph0</a> package on CRAN; igraph0 uses 0-based vertex and
edge ids, and it can be used to run old code. Note, however, that
igraph0 will not be developed in the future. Please use the 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html">
igraph</a> package for current and future work.
</p>

<p class="news">
(Also note that in Python and C vertices and edges are still numbered
from zero, as these languages traditionally use zero-based indexing.)
