<h3>Reporting bugs at Launchpad</h3>

<p>We suggest to report igraph bugs on the Launchpad website by
  clicking on the first button in the menu on the bottom of the page. This
  allows you to follow up on your bug report, e.g. get an email
  notification when it is fixed. Please check the
  <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/igraph/+bugs">list of bugs</a>
  before clicking on the button below to report a new bug.
</p>

<h3>Sending bug reports in email</h3>

If you prefer not to use Launchpad, you can report bugs on
the <code>igraph-help</code> mailing list. You can find more
information on <code>igraph-help</code> 
<a href="support.html">here.</a>
