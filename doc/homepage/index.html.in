<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is another library for creating and manipulating graphs. There is
simply no other graph library out there which can be handle graphs of the
size the author is confronted with efficiently. Whenever possible
<b>igraph</b> tries to be also user friendly and portable.</p>

<p><b>igraph</b> started as an additional package to the
<a href="http://www.r-project.org">GNU R statistical environment</a>,
and still some functions which are hard to implement in C are
available only in R (like interactive graphics). Most functions are however
now written in C and they can be compiled without R as a separate library.
Still the author highly recommends the R package version, as it is a
sophisticated, well designed modern system.</p>

<p>The advantage of the C version is that it is portable, can be used with
other mathematical software (as soon as somebody writes the interfaces to
it), and for large scale scientific computation in the
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor environment</a> we
are using here at <a href="http://cneuro.rmki.kfki.hu">KFKI</a>.</p>

<p><b>igraph</b> also features a
<a href="http://python.org/pypi/igraph">Python interface</a>, and other
interfaces can be added without too much hassle.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>igraph</b> contains functions for generating regular and random graphs
according to known algorithms and models in the network theory
literature.</li>

<li><b>igraph</b> provides routines for manipulating graphs, adding and removing
edges and vertices.</li>

<li>a set of structural property calculation functions like degree,
betweenness, etc. are also included.</li>

<li>force based layout generators for small and large graphs</li>

<li><b>igraph</b> iterators provide a simple and efficient way of walking
through graphs</li>

<li><b>igraph</b> is well documented both for users and developers</li>

<li><b>igraph</b> is open source and distributed under GNU GPL</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>For using the <b>igraph</b> C library the only requirement is a fairly recent C
library. The Python interface requires at least Python 2.4.</p>

<p>For compiling igraph from source you'll need a fairly modern C compiler and
some standard UNIX tools: <code>sed</code>, <code>touch</code>,
<code>chmod</code>, etc. GNU Bison is also needed, at least version
1.35 or newer. Theoretically it is possible to compile <b>igraph</b>
using the Microsoft Visual C Compiler as well, but we recommend the
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> or
<a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> environments for compiling
<b>igraph</b> under Windows.</p>
