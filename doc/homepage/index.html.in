<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>igraph is a free software package for creating and manipulating undirected and 
directed graphs. It includes implementations for classic graph theory
problems like minimum spanning trees and network flow, and also
implements algorithms for some recent network analysis methods, like 
community structure search.</p>

<a name="introduction2"></a>
<p>The efficient implementation of igraph allows it to handle graphs
with millions of vertices and edges. The rule of thumb is that if your graph
fits into the physical memory then igraph can handle it.</p>

<p>igraph can be installed in several forms:
<ol>
<li>igraph as a <i>C library</i> is useful if you want to use
    it in your C/C++ projects, or want to implement your own network analysis
    or model in C/C++ using the data structures and functions igraph provides.
    </li>
<li>igraph as an <i>R package</i>. You can use igraph as an extension 
    package to <a href="http://www.r-project.org">The GNU R project for
    Statistical Computing.</a> The flexibility of the R language and its 
    richness in statistical methods add a great deal of productivity to 
    igraph, with a very small speed penalty.</li>
<li>igraph as a <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> extension module.
    This way you can combine igraph with the huge set of Python functions
    and modules available, and the ease of the Python language,
    with a small speed penalty.</li>
<li>igraph as a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> extension. 
    If you like the Ruby language, then this might be the right choice for you.
    </li>
</ol>
Every form of igraph contain the same code at the very heart, written in ANSI C.</p>


<p>Please note that the ways of installing igraph depends on which its 
forms you actually want to use. Eg. for using igraph as an R package,
you don't need to download the C library at all. See the <a
href="download.html">download page</a> for details.</p>

<a name="features"></a>
<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Here are some features of igraph, a subset of the functionality,
see <i>The igraph reference manual</i> under <a
href="documentation.html">Documentation</a> for more details.

<ol>
<li>igraph contains functions for generating regular and random graphs
according to many algorithms and models from the network theory
literature.</li>
<li>igraph provides routines for manipulating graphs, adding and removing
    edges and vertices.</li>
<li>You can assign numeric or textual attribute to the vertices or edges 
    of the graph, like edge weights or textual vertex ids.</li>
<li>A rich set of functions calculating various structural properties,
    eg. betweenness, page rank, k-cores, network motifs, 
    etc. are also included.</li>
<li>Force based layout generators for small and large graphs</li>
<li>The R package and the Python module can visualize graphs many ways, 
    in 2d and 3d, interactively or non-interactively.
<li>igraph provides data types for implementing your own algorithm in 
    C, R or Python.</li>
<li>Community structure detection algorithms using many recently develop
    heuristics.</li>
<li>igraph can read and write many file formats, like GraphML, GML, Pajek.
    </li>
<li>igraph contains efficient functions for deciding graph isomorphism and
    subgraph isomorphism</li>
<li>It also contains an implementation of the push/relabel algorithm
     for calculating maximum network flow, and this way minimum cuts,
     vertex and edge connectivity.</li>
<li>igraph is well documented both for users and developers.</li>
<li>igraph is open source and distributed under GNU GPL.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>The C library</h3>
    <p>For using the <i>igraph C library</i> only a fairly recent C
    and C++ library is needed. For supporting the GraphML format
    you'll need the libxml2 library.</p>

    <p>For compiling the <i>igraph C library</i> from source you'll
    need a fairly modern C and C++ compiler and some standard UNIX
    tools like make, chmod, touch, etc.</p>

    <p>Most often we use the GNU Compiler Collection for compiling.
    Theoretically it is possible to compile igraph
    using the Microsoft Visual C Compiler as well, but we recommend the
    <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> or
    <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> environments for compiling
    igraph under Windows.</p>

<h3>The GNU R package</h3>
    <p>For using the <i>igraph R package</i> you obviously need 
    GNU R, a recent version like 2.6.0 is recommended, since earlier
    versions contain bugs which effect igraph. If want to compile the 
    R package from source (this is the usual way for Linux systems)
    then you'll need a C and C++ compiler and optionally the libxml
    library.</p>

    <p>For installing the <i>igraph R package</i> on Windows you 
    don't need anything else, just GNU R and the binary igraph R
    package of course</p>

<h3>The Python extension module</h3>

    <p>For installing the <i>Python extension module</i>, you'll
    need Python version 2.4 or later and a C compiler. (Right now this 
    version does not contain C++ code.)</p>

<h3>The Ruby extension</h3>
    <p>For installing the <i>Ruby extension</i> please consult 
    <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/igraph/">the homepage of
    this extension.</a></p>

<h3>Compiling the development version</h3>
    <p>For compiling the development version of igraph, you'll need
    quite a large set of tools: autoconf, automake, GNU bison version
    1.35 or newer, GNU make, maybe more. For compiling the
    documentation you'll need even more tools: Python, Docbook schemas
    and tools, xmlto, makeinfo, patch, docbook2x, maybe more.</p>
