<p><a href="http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/">Pajek</a> is an
excellent network analysis and visualization software written for Windows
(but it runs in Wine under Linux as well). It can handle quite large
(millions of vertices) graphs smoothly. Its main drawbacks are that
(1) it is interactive, (2) closed source, (3) hard to extend.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet.htm">UCINet</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet.htm">UCINet</a> is a
collection of graph analysis software, it also includes
Pajek. It's intended audience is social scientists, and cannot handle large
graphs well. It can be used freely for 30 days and it is closed source.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/index.html">The Boost
Graph Library</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/index.html">The Boost
Graph Library</a> is an impressive library written in C++ for manipulating
graphs. It is quite fast, and can handle moderately large graphs. A good
choice for anyone who likes programming in C++, but it also has interfaces
to some higher level languages.</p>

<h3><a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov">NetworkX</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov">NetworkX</a> is another nice piece of
software written in Python.</p>

<h3><a href="http://erzuli.ss.uci.edu/R.stuff/">SNA</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://erzuli.ss.uci.edu/R.stuff/">SNA</a> (Social Network
Analysis) is an extension package to the GNU R system. It is useful for
small graphs only, as it uses adjacency matrices.</p>
